<h1>History</h1>
The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is an economic and political organization of eight countries in South Asia. It was established in 1985 when the Heads of State of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka formally adopted the charter. Afghanistan joined as the 8th member of SAARC in 2007. To date, 18th Summits have been held and Nepal’s former Foreign Secretary is the current Secretary General of SAARC. The 19th Summit will be hosted by Pakistan in 2016.<br>
<h1>Objectives</h1>SAARC aims to promote economic growth, social progress and cultural development within the South Asia region. The objectives of SAARC, as defined in its charter, are as follows:

Cooperate with international and regional organisation with similar aims and purposes.
<h1>Structure and Process</h1>Cooperation in SAARC is based on respect for the five principles of sovereign equality, territorial integrity, political independence, non-interference in internal affairs of the Member States and mutual benefit. Regional cooperation is seen as a complement to the bilateral and multilateral relations of SAARC Member States.

Decisions are made on an unanimity basis while bilateral and contentious issues are excluded from the deliberations of SAARC. In addition to the eight Member States, nine Observer States join SAARC Summits: China, the US, Myanmar, Iran, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Mauritius and the European Union.

Agriculture and rural development
Education and culture
Biotechnology
Economic, trade and finance
Energy
Environment
Tourism
Science and Technology
Information, Communication and Media
Poverty alleviation
Security aspects
People-to-People Contacts
Funding mechanism

<h1>latest development</h1>The 18th SAARC Summit held in Kathmandu in 2014 concluded with the adoption of the SAARC Declaration. The Declaration recognizes labour migration as an issue in need of collective action. Article 21 states that SAARC countries agree to collaborate to ensure the protection of migrant workers from South Asia. During the Summit, SAARC leaders also called for authorities to tackle and prevent the trafficking in women and children.

In regards to the Post-2015 Development Agenda, participating countries aim to initiate an inter-governmental process to appropriately contextualize the Sustainable Development Goals at the regional level.
